Life is like a train journey.
Where passengers get on every station to reach their destitations.
Similarly in life we get to meet many people.
A few would be from the start, or join in between.
Here a few might leave after short journey, a few might leave after a long journey.
But only few travel along with you till the end.
God introduces every person for a reason.
The person might do good, or something bad.
Each action helps you learn a leasson.
